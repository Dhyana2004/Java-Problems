 1.SortArray:
This Java program showcases the sorting of an array of integers using the built-in sorting function provided by the Java API. By leveraging the efficient built-in sorting algorithm, the program achieves ascending order without the need for implementing a custom sorting algorithm. This approach ensures simplicity, correctness, and optimal performance, making it a convenient solution for sorting tasks in Java programs.The code demonstrates the straightforward usage of the built-in sorting function, offering a clear example for developers seeking to perform array sorting operations in Java. With its concise implementation and reliance on standard library functionality, this solution provides an accessible and reliable method for sorting arrays in ascending order.


 2.DuplicateElementsFinder:
 This Java program efficiently finds duplicate elements in an array and returns them in ascending order. The algorithm is designed to work within the constraints of the provided array, avoiding unnecessary space usage. The problem statement is as follows: given an array `a` of size `N` containing elements from 0 to `N-1`, the program identifies elements that occur more than once in the array. If duplicates are found, they are returned in ascending order; otherwise, a list containing [-1] is returned.The code provides clear comments and follows best practices for readability and maintainability. It utilizes nested loops to compare elements and track duplicates. Upon completion, it prints the duplicate elements found or [-1] if none are present.This solution offers an efficient approach to identifying duplicate elements in an array, suitable for various Java programming tasks and challenges.
